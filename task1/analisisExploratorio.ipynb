    "\n",
    "- **`Linear Regression`**: They can affect the estimation of the model coefficients, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. This is because the estimation of these coefficientes is done by minimizing the sum of the quadratic errors, and outliers can generate large quadratic errors, which affects model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Random Forest Regressor`**: It is more robust to outliers. This is because this model consists of making predictions from several decision trees from subsets of the data and then calculation the mean of each of the results obtained. In this way, the outliers lose weight against other data with a hihger degree of similarity to te data used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Stochastic Gradient Descent`**: Outliers can negatively affect this model. This is because, since the training algorithm updates the parameters iteratively using only one training example at a time, outliers can cause very large parameter updates in the learning process preventing it from converging effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Random Forest Classifier`**: The degree to which outliers affect is the same as the *Random Forest Regressor*, since the only difference between the two models is the output they generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Logistic Regression`**: This model is sensitive to outliers as they affect the estimation of coefficients. However, the versions with regularization (Lasso and Ridge) penalize large coefficients, which reduces the influence of outliers, thus improving the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`K-Nearest Neighbors`**:It is very sensitive to outliers, since this model is based on the idea that nearby data points have similar characteristics (*\"If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it's probably a duck. ”*). If an outlier is close to a decision point, it may cause the model to classify incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Naive Bayes`**: This is relatively robust to outliers. This model assumes that the features follow a normal distribution and calculates probabilities based only on the mean and standard deviation. The outliers, having extremely low probability, have minimal impact on the final predictions, as their influence is diluted in the overall calculation."
